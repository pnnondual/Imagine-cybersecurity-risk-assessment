# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment for a Small Business (Hypothetical Pet Shop) ## Project Objective This project demonstrates the fundamental steps involved in conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment for a hypothetical small business. The goal was to identify, analyze, and propose mitigation strategies for potential cyber risks. ## Key Assets Identified * Customer Data * Customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) * Payment Card Industry Data (PCI Data) / Payment Information ## Identified Threats * Phishing Attacks * Physical Attacks (e.g., theft of devices) * Brute-Force / Credential Stuffing Attacks * Malware * Insider Threats * Ransomware ## Identified Vulnerabilities * Untrained Employees * Weak Passwords and Verifications * Outdated Software on Payment Systems / Devices * Lack of Antivirus Software ## Risk Assessment (Example) A key risk identified was the **medium likelihood** of **phishing attacks** exploiting **untrained employees**, leading to a **high impact** due to the potential compromise of sensitive customer and payment data. ## Recommended Controls Based on the assessment, the following controls were recommended: * **Employee Security Awareness Training Program:** To educate staff on identifying and reporting phishing attempts, and general security best practices. * **Strong Password and Multi-Factor Authentication Policy:** To enforce robust authentication for all sensitive systems and accounts. * **Regular Software Updates and Patch Management:** To ensure all operating systems and applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches. * **Implementation of Antivirus/Endpoint Protection Software:** To provide real-time protection against malware. ## Skills Demonstrated * Risk Assessment * Vulnerability Management * Threat Identification * Security Controls Recommendation * Understanding of Information Security Principles
